Actually, I think this assignment is also transfer math formula into code.
Therefore, the variable name is really easy to understand and there is no 
 need to cite again. x, y represents cordination, rows, cols is row and colomn.
I do not use OOP which may cause a bit difficulty to read? Sorry for my poor py.
